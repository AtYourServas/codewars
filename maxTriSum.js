/* Task
Given an array/list [] of n integers , find maximum triplet sum in the array Without duplications .

Notes :
Array/list size is at least 3 .

Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives , negatives and zeros .

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when summing).

Input >> Output Examples
1- maxTriSum ({3,2,6,8,2,3}) ==> return (17)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {6,8,3} in order , their sum is (17)

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

2- maxTriSum ({2,1,8,0,6,4,8,6,2,4}) ==> return (18)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {8, 6, 4} in order , their sum is (18) ,

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

3- maxTriSum ({-7,12,-7,29,-5,0,-7,0,0,29}) ==> return (41)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {12 , 29 , 0} in order , their sum is (41) ,

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once . */

// PARAMETERS:  an array of integers with length >= 3
// RETURN:  highest possible sum of three unique integers within the provided array
// EXAMPLES:  see above
// PSEUDOCODE:  create a set of unique values and have it sorted from lowest to highest
//              sum the last three values of the array

function maxTriSum(numbers){
    return ([...new Set(numbers)]).sort((a,b) => a-b).slice(-3).reduce((a,b) => a+b);
  }
